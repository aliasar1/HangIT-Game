# HangIT-Game

This project is implemented using java forms to create beautiful GUI.
This game has 1 mega game which is connected by 3 mini games in order to survive.

Here's the logic behind the game- HangIT. The central idea of the game is to complete a particular word using letters to guess it. It’s filled with plenty of easy as well as difficult words displayed in random order each time you play.
The more mistakes that a player makes in guessing the word and filling the gaps, the lives of the player will be decreased until they reaches at 0 lives. Once the lives reaches at 0, 3 mini games will be enable to play as a bonus live to win. 
Here are some other salient features of the game:
•	First the mega game will be started with 3 lives in hand initially.
•	If player guesses the letters in the word wrong, the lives would be decremented to 0. And once they reach at 0. 3 mini game will be enable to play according to player preference. 
•	If the player wins the mini game, he would have +1 live or else he will lose.
•	If the player guess the word correctly, he will be allowed to further proceed with another round if he wants.
HangIT is a game worth to be played by all ages if they know Basic English. This will encourage more and more people to learn and play simultaneously,
